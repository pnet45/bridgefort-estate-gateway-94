title: AI Observability Setup - Install
description: Declare the packages the variant needs, and no others
---

Declare the packages in the project manifest. Do not run the package manager. The build step installs them later.

Read the manifest first. If a package is already there, keep its version and say so in the report. Match the style of the entries around it.

## Providers and gateways

Every provider and every OpenAI-compatible gateway needs the PostHog SDK next to the vendor SDK.

| Runtime | Packages |
|---|---|
| Python | `posthog` |
| Node | `@posthog/ai`, `posthog-node` |

**Do not add OpenTelemetry packages.** The wrapper path needs none. If you reach for `opentelemetry-sdk`, `posthog[otel]`, or an `opentelemetry-instrumentation-*` package, you picked the wrong mechanism. Go back to `3-instrument.md`.

The vendor SDK is already in the manifest. Do not add or upgrade it.

**Watch the pinned major version.** The openai wrapper and every `opentelemetry-instrumentation-*` bridge target the modern client API (`openai>=1.x`, `client.chat.completions.create`). A project pinned to a pre-1.0 `openai` (the flat `openai.ChatCompletion` / `openai.Embedding` module API) gives them nothing to patch, and you must not upgrade it — so the instrumentation silently emits no events. Use `manual-capture` and wrap the real calls with `posthog.capture()` instead. The same holds for any provider pinned below its current client interface.

Portkey also needs `portkey-ai`.

## Other variants

| Variant | Packages |
|---|---|
| Agent frameworks | The list the install doc names |
| `opentelemetry-*`, LlamaIndex, AWS Bedrock | The OTel packages the install doc names |
| `manual-capture` | `posthog` or `posthog-node` |

AWS Bedrock has no wrapper client. It instruments the AWS SDK through OpenTelemetry, so its package list differs from every other provider.

`opentelemetry-go` declares `github.com/posthog/posthog-go/otel` and the OpenTelemetry SDK modules in `go.mod`. There are no Go instrumentation libraries for provider SDKs; step 3 hand-authors the `gen_ai.*` spans instead.

Go is the exception to the no-package-manager and no-lockfile rules on this page. A `go.mod` require line with no matching `go.sum` entry fails the build with `missing go.sum entry for module`, so let the tool write both files: `go get github.com/posthog/posthog-go/otel go.opentelemetry.io/otel go.opentelemetry.io/otel/sdk`, then `go mod tidy`. Do not hand-edit `go.mod` or `go.sum`.

## Do not

- Do not run `npm install` or `pip install`.
- Do not edit the lockfile. On Go, `go get` and `go mod tidy` write `go.mod` and `go.sum` for you.
- Do not upgrade the vendor SDK.
- Do not add OpenTelemetry to a wrapper variant.
